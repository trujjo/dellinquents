        <h2>UMEC Content</h2>
        <p>The Undergraduate Medical Education Committee (UMEC) oversees the Dell Med curriculum. UMEC is made up of the general committee along with numerous subcommittees in charge of different aspects of the curriculum. You can find your class representatives here.</p>
        <p>The General UMEC committee meets monthly, and each month your MS3 representatives on the committee will send out a recap email for that month’s meetings.</p>
